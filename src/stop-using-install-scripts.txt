Stop Using Install Scripts

Directing people to run shell scripts via a link with (sometimes) sudo-user privileges is bad. It promotes bad habits, and it is redundant.

Developers should not take the liberty of recommending this method of installation. I think they should provide a list of binaries for the various archectures for installation. I don't think they should automate this process and take it out of the hands of the user. I think that new-users who don't know what system they have should not be instilled with this bad habit, I think they should be educated. I also think that a link-based installation script should be available for educated developers woh know the risks â€” I think an educative banners should be displayed as a warning and message above the installation link. We should not use langauge like "just paste this in any unix terminal". We should use language like "Scripts can be dangeous, exercise caution, view this scripts source, and maintaine vigilence".
