So just above this paragraph we had the introduction paragraph, it has a slightly larger font size for the sake of emphasis. Its also designed to be shorter than the rest of the content paragraphs, for stylistic purposes. I'm not sure what to write more of in this particular paragraph. Perhaps I could talk about how I used Python to write the HTML generation script. However, I don't really feel like typing about that, so I'm not going to. We're getting close enough to long enough now any way, so it's probably fine if I just finish this ramble then start the next paragraph.

Here we have the next paragraph. Notice it doesn't have an enlarged first letter, this is because that is reserved for the first paragraph. Note that we have three types of paragraph. We have the introduction paragraph which is a few sentences to catch the readers attention, provide a TL;DR, or do something else, I don't know and I don't care what you will do with it. Next we have the next paragraph, the canonical "first" paragraph, which has an enlarged first letter, as it is fairly typical in written production. After that paragraph we have "content" paragraphs, which this is the first of. 

Now we have the second content paragraph, or fourth (1-based indexing), total paragraph. I'm done writing so I'll end it here.
